# ZeroTier Network Connector
This software allows anyone connected to the internet to connect to any of the zerotier's network id which are submitted by users. Want to host a party with just you and your friends you can do so without having them type or copy in their network id as the software does it for you. Pretend it's a network id roomlist which zerotier doesn't or lacks of it's feature for a room network list. One thing to note however is that I completely forgot to implement a warning but this software uses the internet to communicate with ztlist.wolf.mba so some data charges may apply depending on your ISP.

# Plans for next upcoming projects
I'm still thinking as far as opening this project up to the public.
